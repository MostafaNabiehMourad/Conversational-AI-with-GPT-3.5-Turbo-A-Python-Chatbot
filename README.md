# Conversational AI with GPT 3.5 Turbo A Python Chatbot

Installation of OpenAI Library: The code begins by installing the OpenAI library using pip. It imports the library as openai.

API Key Setup: An API key for OpenAI is provided as openai.api_key, allowing you to authenticate and access the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

Chat Initialization: The conversation starts with a system message, setting the context that the assistant is an intelligent assistant.

User-Assistant Interaction Loop: The code enters a loop where the user can input messages one by one. These messages are added to the messages list, alternating between the user and the assistant roles.

OpenAI Chat Completion: After each user input, the code makes a call to OpenAI's ChatCompletion API with the conversation history provided in the messages list. This API call generates a response based on the user input and the previous conversation history.

Displaying Assistant's Reply: The assistant's reply is extracted from the API response and displayed as "ChatGPT" followed by the reply text.

Updating Conversation History: The assistant's reply is added to the conversation history as an assistant message, ensuring that it becomes part of the context for generating future responses.

This code essentially allows you to have a conversation with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, where you input messages, and the model responds based on the conversation context.

Please note that the OpenAI API key provided in your code snippet should be kept secure, and you should follow OpenAI's usage policies and guidelines when using their services. Additionally, the code can be extended and customized to handle various conversation scenarios and tasks.
